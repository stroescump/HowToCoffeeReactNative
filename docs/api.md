# API Documentation (Placeholder)

This file is a placeholder for the HowToCoffee API documentation.

Recommended next steps:
- Add an OpenAPI spec (e.g., `openapi.yaml`) and link it here.
- Or document endpoints manually with request/response examples.

Suggested structure:
- Base URL and auth
- Endpoints by feature (auth, diagnose, recipes, marketplace)
- Request/response payloads
- Error codes
